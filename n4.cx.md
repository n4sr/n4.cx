# How to Setup Minecraft and Join The Server
Hello, and welcome to `s.n4.cx`, a modded survival Minecraft server! This page provides instructions on how to get the server modpack set up. If you need further assistance in setting this up, please send me a message on Discord or Signal. I hope to see you on the server.
# Using PrismLauncher
We will be using a different launcher so that the installation of mods is easy. Doing this with the default launcher is much more complex and time consuming. I use PrismLauncher, however a guide to other working launchers exists [here](https://docs.modrinth.com/docs/modpacks/playing_modpacks/). You will just have to download them and install them using other guides if needed. These launchers can be installed alongside the official Minecraft launcher, so you can still use that as you wish, but you will just need to use PrismLauncher in order to connect to this server.


## Step 1: Installing Java
While the default minecraft launcher comes with Java, it does not install it system-wide. You will need to install Java in order to install the launcher. If you do not already have Java installed on your system independant of Minecraft, then you may experience an error when attempting to install the launcher. You can download OpenJDK 17 (Java) from either Microsoft or Adoptium using one of the links below.

**Microsoft:**

* [Windows](https://aka.ms/download-jdk/microsoft-jdk-17.0.7-windows-x64.msi)
* [MacOS](https://aka.ms/download-jdk/microsoft-jdk-17.0.7-macOS-x64.pkg)
* [Linux](https://aka.ms/download-jdk/microsoft-jdk-17.0.7-linux-x64.tar.gz) (cmon, just use your package manager)

**Adoptium:**

* [Any](https://adoptium.net/download/)

**Note: a system restart may be required upon the completion of the OpenJDK installation.**

## Step 2: Installing the launcher
You can download the launcher here: [https://prismlauncher.org/download/](https://prismlauncher.org/download/). Click on the version that matches your operating system. Run the installer and follow the on screen instructions.

Once you have the launcher installed, you will need to login to your account:

* Click on `Accounts > Manage Accounts`.
* In the Account Settings window, click Add Microsoft.
* In the `Add Microsoft Account` window, click `Open page and copy code`. (Check your existing browser window if it does not automatically show up.)
* Paste your code into the page and follow the on-screen instructions.
* Once complete, you should see your account show up in the list with the status listed as `Ready`.

After your account is set up, then you can proceed to the next step.

## Step 3: Downloading and Importing the Modpack
You can download the modpack here: [https://github.com/n4sr/modpack/releases/latest](https://github.com/n4sr/modpack/releases/latest)

If you enabled shell file assoications when installing in Step 1, then you will just need to right-click on the `s.n4.cx.mrpack` file and click "Open with PrismLauncher".

Otherwise, you will need to the following:

* Open PrismLauncher and click `File > Add instance...`
* In the New Instance window, click on Import from zip, then click Browse.
* In the Choose Modpack window, make sure you have it set to show `Modrinth pack (*.mrpack)` in the bottom right, then select the `s.n4.cx.mrpack` file and click open.
* In the New instance window, click OK. The launcher should now be downloading the required mods from Modrinth.
* After the mods have finished downloading, launch the instance. Some libraries distributed by Mojang will have to download before it will launch.

**Note: The first launch may take a while.** You can monitor the progress by clicking `Edit` on the instance and clicking the `Bottom` button. Again, if something ends up getting stuck and you need help, please message me and I will offer any assistance I can.

# Mods Included in this Modpack
There are a lot of different mods included in this modpack. I have created an incomplete list of them, along with a brief description on them. I recommend going to `ESC > Options... > Controls... > Key binds...` and looking through the controls and rebinding keys if neccessary. Not every key needs to be bound. If you have any questions about the mods, you can read about them below. Links to each mod are included.

### [Simple Voice Chat](https://modrinth.com/plugin/simple-voice-chat)
Simple Voice Chat is a mod that adds proximity voice chat in-game. This means that you need to be within a certain distance in order to hear other players. If you see a plug crossed out in red, that means that your client failed to connect to the in-game voice chat. Open your settings and look through your key binds. It will tell you how to use push-to-talk, mute your mic, or open the voice chat settings. Join a group in order to voice chat over long distances!

If you plan on using the Simple Voice Chat mod: I would recommend unbinding everything under voice chat except `Voice Chat GUI` and `Push To Talk` (if applicable). All of the relevant settings are accessable through the menu.

### [World Map](https://modrinth.com/mod/xaeros-world-map)
This world map allows you to see area you have already explored on it. It also displays any land claims from Open Parties and Claims.

In the keybinds under `Xaero's World Map`, make sure that `Open World Map` is bound. All of the World Map settings and minimap settings can be accessed from the map screen by clicking the gear icon in the top left.

### [Open Parties and Claims](https://modrinth.com/mod/open-parties-and-claims)
This mod will allow you to claim land, which will protect it from fire spread, creepers, and other players.

In the keybinds under `Open Parties and Claims`, bind `Open Parties and Claims Menu` to a key of your choosing. This will allow you to change the permissions on your land claims.

### [Roughly Enough Items](https://modrinth.com/mod/rei)
This mod shows you all the items in the game, and provides information on how to craft them or use them. You can access the settings menu by clicking on the gear icon at the bottom of your inventory screen. By default, pressing the `R` key while hovering over an item will show the crafting recipe for it. Pressing the `U` key while hovering over an item will show you information on what the item can be used for. All keybinds in this mod can be changed by accessing the REI settings by clicking the gear on the inventory screen.

### [You're In Grave Danger](https://modrinth.com/mod/yigd)
This mod adds graves when a player dies. The graves contain all of the player's items, so they do not despawn over time. Right-clicking on the grave automatically arranges all of the items back into your inventory where they were.

### [Tree Harvester](https://modrinth.com/mod/tree-harvester)
Hold sneak while chopping a tree down with an axe and and it will chop the entire tree down. You may have break the bottom block a few times, but it will come down. This is much faster and more convenient than chopping each block individually. The axe will recieve the same durability cost as if you chopped each block indiviudally.

### [Better Nether](https://modrinth.com/mod/betternether)
This mod adds a ton of new biomes, blocks, and items to the Nether. I am very impressed with the variety included here.

### [Better End](https://modrinth.com/mod/betterend)
Better End is an overhaul of the End Dimension. This adds biomes, mobs, structures and more.

### [Joy of Painting](https://modrinth.com/mod/joy-of-painting)
Create a canvas, grab your color palette, set up your easel, and start painting! This paintings can be viewed by other players!

### [Immersive Paintings](https://modrinth.com/mod/immersive-paintings)
Import and generate paintings using existing images. The pipeline from Instagram meme pages staight to the server has never been more streamlined! 

### [Create](https://modrinth.com/mod/create-fabric)
This mod is probably the biggest one on the server. It allows you to automate a whole bunch of tasks using machines. You can learn more about the mod by clicking on the goggles in-game or pressing `W` over a Create machine component in your inventory to ponder it.

### [Modern Industrialization](https://modrinth.com/mod/modern-industrialization)
Nuclear reactors, Quarries, Resource Generation, etc. Build and automate cool infrastructure!

### [ComputerCraft](https://modrinth.com/mod/cc-restitched)
This mod adds Lua-powered computers and robots to the game. Code your own programs or import programs found online!
