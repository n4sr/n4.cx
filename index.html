<h1 id="how-to-setup-minecraft-and-join-the-server">How to Setup
Minecraft and Join The Server</h1>
<p>This guide will serve as a living document for instructions on how to
setup the server modpack to join <code>s.n4.cx</code>. If you need to be
added to the whitelist, or any help with getting stuff working, you can
message me on Discord or Signal and I will be there.</p>
<h2 id="using-prismlauncher">Using PrismLauncher</h2>
<p>We will be using a different launcher so that the installation of
mods is easy. Doing this with the default launcher is much more complex
and time consuming. I use PrismLauncher, however a guide to other
working launchers exists <a
href="https://docs.modrinth.com/docs/modpacks/playing_modpacks/">here</a>.
You will just have to download them and install them using other guides
if needed. These launchers can be installed alongside the official
Minecraft launcher, so you can still use that as you wish, but you will
just need to use PrismLauncher in order to connect to this server.</p>
<h3 id="step-1-installing-java">Step 1: Installing Java</h3>
<p>While the default minecraft launcher comes with Java, it does not
install it system-wide. You will need to install Java in order to
install the launcher. If you do not already have Java installed on your
system independant of Minecraft, then you may experience an error when
attempting to install the launcher. You can download OpenJDK 17 (Java)
from the links below.</p>
<p><strong>Microsoft:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a
href="https://aka.ms/download-jdk/microsoft-jdk-17.0.7-windows-x64.msi">Windows</a></li>
<li><a
href="https://aka.ms/download-jdk/microsoft-jdk-17.0.7-macOS-x64.pkg">MacOS</a></li>
<li><a
href="https://aka.ms/download-jdk/microsoft-jdk-17.0.7-linux-x64.tar.gz">Linux</a>
(cmon, just use your package manager)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Adoptium</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://adoptium.net/download/">Any</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note: a system restart may be required upon the completion of
the OpenJDK installation.</strong></p>
<h3 id="step-2-installing-the-launcher">Step 2: Installing the
launcher</h3>
<p>You can download the launcher here: <a
href="https://prismlauncher.org/download/">https://prismlauncher.org/download/</a>.
Click on the version that matches your operating system. Run the
installer and follow the on screen instructions.</p>
<p>Once you have the launcher installed, you will need to login to your
account:</p>
<ul>
<li>Click on <code>Accounts &gt; Manage Accounts</code>.</li>
<li>In the Account Settings window, click Add Microsoft.</li>
<li>In the <code>Add Microsoft Account</code> window, click
<code>Open page and copy code</code>. (Check your existing browser
window if it does not automatically show up.)</li>
<li>Paste your code into the page and follow the on-screen
instructions.</li>
<li>Once complete, you should see your account show up in the list with
the status listed as <code>Ready</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>After your account is set up, then you can proceed to the next
step.</p>
<h3 id="step-3-downloading-and-importing-the-modpack">Step 3:
Downloading and Importing the Modpack</h3>
<p>You can download the modpack here: <a
href="https://github.com/n4sr/modpack/releases/latest">https://github.com/n4sr/modpack/releases/latest</a></p>
<p>If you enabled shell file assoications when installing in Step 1,
then you will just need to right-click on the
<code>s.n4.cx.mrpack</code> file and click “Open with
PrismLauncher”.</p>
<p>Otherwise, you will need to the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open PrismLauncher and click
<code>File &gt; Add instance...</code></li>
<li>In the New Instance window, click on Import from zip, then click
Browse.</li>
<li>In the Choose Modpack window, make sure you have it set to show
<code>Modrinth pack (*.mrpack)</code> in the bottom right, then select
the <code>s.n4.cx.mrpack</code> file and click open.</li>
<li>In the New instance window, click OK. The launcher should now be
downloading the required mods from Modrinth.</li>
<li>After the mods have finished downloading, launch the instance. Some
libraries distributed by Mojang will have to download before it will
launch.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note: The first launch may take a while.</strong> You can
monitor the progress by clicking <code>Edit</code> on the instance and
clicking the <code>Bottom</code> button. Again, if something ends up
getting stuck and you need help, please message me and I will offer any
assistance I can.</p>
<h2 id="mods-included-in-this-modpack">Mods Included in this
Modpack</h2>
<p>There are a lot of different mods included in this modpack. I have
created an incomplete list of them, along with a brief description on
them. I recommend going to
<code>ESC &gt; Options... &gt; Controls... &gt; Key binds...</code> and
looking through the controls and rebind keys if neccessary. Not every
key needs to be bound. If you have any questions about the mods, you can
read about them below. Links to each mod are included.</p>
<h3 id="simple-voice-chat"><a
href="https://modrinth.com/plugin/simple-voice-chat">Simple Voice
Chat</a></h3>
<p>Simple Voice Chat is a mod that adds proximity voice chat in-game.
This means that you need to be within a certain distance in order to
hear other players. If you see a plug crossed out in red, that means
that your client failed to connect to the in-game voice chat. Open your
settings and look through your key binds. It will tell you how to use
push-to-talk, mute your mic, or open the voice chat settings. Join a
group in order to voice chat over long distances!</p>
<p>If you plan on using the Simple Voice Chat mod: I would recommend
unbinding everything under voice chat except <code>Voice Chat GUI</code>
and <code>Push To Talk</code> (if applicable). All of the relevant
settings are accessable through the menu.</p>
<h3 id="world-map"><a
href="https://modrinth.com/mod/xaeros-world-map">World Map</a></h3>
<p>This world map allows you to see area you have already explored on
it. It also displays any land claims from Open Parties and Claims.</p>
<p>In the keybinds under <code>Xaero's World Map</code>, make sure that
<code>Open World Map</code> is bound. All of the World Map settings and
minimap settings can be accessed from the map screen by clicking the
gear icon in the top left.</p>
<h3 id="open-parties-and-claims"><a
href="https://modrinth.com/mod/open-parties-and-claims">Open Parties and
Claims</a></h3>
<p>This mod will allow you to claim land, which will protect it from
fire spread, creepers, and other players.</p>
<p>In the keybinds under <code>Open Parties and Claims</code>, bind
<code>Open Parties and Claims Menu</code> to a key of your choosing.
This will allow you to change the permissions on your land claims.</p>
<h3 id="roughly-enough-items"><a
href="https://modrinth.com/mod/rei">Roughly Enough Items</a></h3>
<p>This mod shows you all the items in the game, and provides
information on how to craft them or use them. You can access the
settings menu by clicking on the gear icon at the bottom of your
inventory screen. By default, pressing the <code>R</code> key while
hovering over an item will show the crafting recipe for it. Pressing the
<code>U</code> key while hovering over an item will show you information
on what the item can be used for. All keybinds in this mod can be
changed by accessing the REI settings by clicking the gear on the
inventory screen.</p>
<h3 id="youre-in-grave-danger"><a
href="https://modrinth.com/mod/yigd">You’re In Grave Danger</a></h3>
<p>This mod adds graves when a player dies. The graves contain all of
the player’s items, so they do not despawn over time. Right-clicking on
the grave automatically arranges all of the items back into your
inventory where they were.</p>
<h3 id="tree-harvester"><a
href="https://modrinth.com/mod/tree-harvester">Tree Harvester</a></h3>
<p>Hold sneak while chopping a tree down with an axe and and it will
chop the entire tree down. You may have break the bottom block a few
times, but it will come down. This is much faster and more convenient
than chopping each block individually. The axe will recieve the same
durability cost as if you chopped each block indiviudally.</p>
<h3 id="better-nether"><a
href="https://modrinth.com/mod/betternether">Better Nether</a></h3>
<p>This mod adds a ton of new biomes, blocks, and items to the Nether. I
am very impressed with the variety included here.</p>
<h3 id="better-end"><a href="https://modrinth.com/mod/betterend">Better
End</a></h3>
<p>Better End is an overhaul of the End Dimension. This adds biomes,
mobs, structures and more.</p>
<h3 id="joy-of-painting"><a
href="https://modrinth.com/mod/joy-of-painting">Joy of Painting</a></h3>
<p>Create a canvas, grab your color palette, set up your easel, and
start painting!</p>
<h3 id="create"><a
href="https://modrinth.com/mod/create-fabric">Create</a></h3>
<p>This mod is probably the biggest one on the server. It allows you to
automate a whole bunch of tasks using machines. You can learn more about
the mod by clicking on the goggles in-game. It will display visuals on
how differnt machines work.</p>
<h3 id="modern-industrialization"><a
href="https://modrinth.com/mod/modern-industrialization">Modern
Industrialization</a></h3>
<p>Nuclear reactors, Quarries, Resource Generation, etc. This one is a
little complex. Craft the in-game guide book for further
information.</p>
<h3 id="computercraft"><a
href="https://modrinth.com/mod/cc-restitched">ComputerCraft</a></h3>
<p>This mod adds Lua-powered computers to the game. You can do a lot of
cool stuff with them. It is a great way to learn how to code. I would
look into tutorials for them, because they are pretty cool.</p>
