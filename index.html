<h1 id="how-to-setup-minecraft-and-join-the-server">How to Setup
Minecraft and Join The Server</h1>
<p>This guide will serve as a living document for instructions on how to
setup the server modpack to join <code>s.n4.cx</code>. If you need to be
added to the whitelist, or any help, you can message me on Discord or
Signal.</p>
<h2 id="using-prismlauncher">Using PrismLauncher</h2>
<p>We will be using a different launcher so that the installation of
mods is easy. Doing this with the default launcher is much more complex
and time consuming. I use PrismLauncher, however a guide to other
working launchers exists <a
href="https://docs.modrinth.com/docs/modpacks/playing_modpacks/">here</a>.
You will just have to download them and install them using other guides
if needed. These launchers can be installed alongside the official
Minecraft launcher, so ayou can still use that as you wish, but you will
just need to use PrismLauncher in order to connect to this server.</p>
<h3 id="step-1-installing-the-launcher">Step 1: Installing the
launcher</h3>
<p>You can download the launcher here: <a
href="https://prismlauncher.org/download/">https://prismlauncher.org/download/</a>.
Click on the version that matches your operating system. Run the
installer and follow the on screen instructions.</p>
<h3 id="step-2-installing-java">Step 2: Installing Java</h3>
<p>While Java comes with the default Minecraft launcher, if you do not
have Java installed on your system independant of Minecraft, then you
may experience an error when attempting to launch the game. If you get
these errors, then you can download OpenJDK from <a
href="https://www.microsoft.com/openjdk">Microsoft</a> or <a
href="https://adoptium.net/">Adoptium</a>. Either one should work.</p>
<h3 id="step-3-downloading-and-importing-the-modpack">Step 3:
Downloading and Importing the Modpack</h3>
<p>You can download the modpack here: <a
href="https://github.com/n4sr/modpack/releases/latest">https://github.com/n4sr/modpack/releases/latest</a></p>
<p>If you enabled shell file assoications when installing in Step 1,
then you will just need to right-click on the
<code>s.n4.cx.mrpack</code> file and click “Open with
PrismLauncher”.</p>
<p>Otherwise, you will need to the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open PrismLauncher and click
<code>File &gt; Add instance...</code></li>
<li>In the New Instance window, click on Import from zip, then click
Browse.</li>
<li>In the Choose Modpack window, make sure you have it set to show
Modrinth pack (*.mrpack), then select the <code>s.n4.cx.mrpack</code>
file and click open.</li>
<li>In the New instance window, click OK. The launcher should now be
downloading the required mods from Modrinth.</li>
<li>After the mods have finished downloading, launch the instance.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="using-this-modpack">Using this Modpack</h2>
<p>There are a lot of different mods included in this modpack. I do not
have enough experience with all of them in order to explain them here.
If you have any questions about the mods, I would recommend searching
the internet for documentation. I will try to update this as time goes
on.</p>
<h3 id="simple-voice-chat"><a
href="https://modrinth.com/plugin/simple-voice-chat">Simple Voice
Chat</a></h3>
<p>Simple Voice Chat is a mod that adds proximity voice chat in-game.
This means that you need to be within a certain distance in order to
hear other players. If you see a plug crossed out in red, that means
that your client failed to connect to the in-game voice chat. Open your
settings and look through your key binds. It will tell you how to use
push-to-talk, mute your mic, or open the voice chat settings.</p>
<h3 id="youre-in-grave-danger"><a
href="https://modrinth.com/mod/yigd">You’re In Grave Danger</a></h3>
<p>This mod adds graves when a player dies. The graves contain all of
the player’s items, so they do not despawn over time.</p>
<h3 id="open-parties-and-claims"><a
href="https://modrinth.com/mod/open-parties-and-claims">Open Parties and
Claims</a></h3>
<p>This mod will allow you to claim land, which will protect it from
fire spread, creepers, and other players.</p>
<h3 id="world-map"><a
href="https://modrinth.com/mod/xaeros-world-map">World Map</a></h3>
<p>This world map allows you to see area you have already explored on
it. It also displays any land claims from Open Parties and Claims.</p>
<h3 id="create"><a
href="https://modrinth.com/mod/create-fabric">Create</a></h3>
<p>This mod is probably the biggest one on the server. It allows you to
automate a whole bunch of tasks using machines. You can learn more about
the mod by clicking on the goggles in-game. It will display visuals on
how differnt machines work.</p>
<h3 id="computercraft"><a
href="https://modrinth.com/mod/cc-restitched">ComputerCraft</a></h3>
<p>This mod adds Lua-powered computers to the game. You can do a lot of
cool stuff with them. It is a great way to learn how to code. I would
look into tutorials for them, because they are pretty cool.</p>
<h3 id="appleskin"><a
href="https://modrinth.com/mod/appleskin">AppleSkin</a></h3>
<p>This mod shows you how much a food item will restore on the food and
health bars.</p>
