<h1 id="about-this-server">About this Server</h1>
<p>Hello, and welcome to <code>s.n4.cx</code>, a modded survival
Minecraft server! This page provides instructions on how to get the
server modpack set up. If you need further assistance in setting this
up, please send me a message on Discord or Signal. I hope to see you on
the server.</p>
<h1 id="how-to-setup-minecraft-and-join-the-server">How to Setup
Minecraft and Join The Server</h1>
<p>To start, you will need to install the modpack using PrismLauncher.
PrismLauncher is different Minecraft launcher with additional features
that makes setup easy. The default Minecraft launcher does not support
installing modpacks, so this guide will instruct you on how to install
and setup PrismLauncher. You do not need to uninstall the default
Minecraft launcher in order to use this, so all of your saves and other
data will remain untouched. You will only need to use this launcher when
playing on this server.</p>
<h2 id="step-1-installing-java">Step 1: Installing Java</h2>
<p>While the default minecraft launcher comes with Java, it does not
install it system-wide, so that other programs can use it. You will need
Java in order to install the launcher. If you do not already have Java
installed on your system, then you can download OpenJDK 17 (Java) from
either Microsoft or Adoptium using one of the links below.</p>
<p><strong>Microsoft:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a
href="https://aka.ms/download-jdk/microsoft-jdk-17.0.7-windows-x64.msi">Windows</a></li>
<li><a
href="https://aka.ms/download-jdk/microsoft-jdk-17.0.7-macOS-x64.pkg">MacOS</a></li>
<li><a
href="https://aka.ms/download-jdk/microsoft-jdk-17.0.7-linux-x64.tar.gz">Linux</a>
(cmon, just use your package manager)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Adoptium:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://adoptium.net/download/">Any</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note: a system restart may be required upon the completion of
the OpenJDK installation.</strong></p>
<h2 id="step-2-installing-the-launcher">Step 2: Installing the
launcher</h2>
<p>You can download the launcher here: <a
href="https://prismlauncher.org/download/">https://prismlauncher.org/download/</a>.
Click on the version that matches your operating system. Run the
installer and follow the on screen instructions.</p>
<p>Once you have the launcher installed, you will need to login to your
account:</p>
<ul>
<li>Click on <code>Accounts &gt; Manage Accounts</code>.</li>
<li>In the Account Settings window, click Add Microsoft.</li>
<li>In the <code>Add Microsoft Account</code> window, click
<code>Open page and copy code</code>. (Check your existing browser
window if it does not automatically show up.)</li>
<li>Paste your code into the page and follow the on-screen
instructions.</li>
<li>Once complete, you should see your account show up in the list with
the status listed as <code>Ready</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>After your account is set up, then you can proceed to the next
step.</p>
<h2 id="step-3-downloading-and-importing-the-modpack">Step 3:
Downloading and Importing the Modpack</h2>
<p>You can download the modpack here: <a
href="https://github.com/n4sr/modpack/releases/latest">https://github.com/n4sr/modpack/releases/latest</a></p>
<p>If you enabled shell file assoications when installing in Step 1,
then you will just need to right-click on the
<code>s.n4.cx.mrpack</code> file and click “Open with
PrismLauncher”.</p>
<p>Otherwise, you will need to the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open PrismLauncher and click
<code>File &gt; Add instance...</code>.</li>
<li>In the New Instance window, click on Import from zip, then click
Browse.</li>
<li>In the Choose Modpack window, make sure you have it set to show
<code>Modrinth pack (*.mrpack)</code> in the bottom right, then select
the <code>s.n4.cx.mrpack</code> file and click open.</li>
<li>In the New instance window, click OK. The launcher should now be
downloading the required mods from Modrinth.</li>
<li>After the mods have finished downloading, launch the instance!</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note: The first launch may take a while.</strong> You can
monitor the progress by clicking <code>Edit</code> on the instance and
clicking the <code>Bottom</code> button. Again, if something ends up
getting stuck and you need help, please message me and I will offer any
assistance I can.</p>
<h2 id="step-4-joining-the-server">Step 4: Joining the Server</h2>
<p>The server is included within the modpack already, so you only need
to click Multiplayer and join the server. You can also type
<code>s.n4.cx</code> into the direct connect box and click connect to
join the server.</p>
<h1 id="mods-included-in-this-modpack">Mods Included in this
Modpack</h1>
<p>There are a lot of different mods included in this modpack. I have
created an incomplete list of them, along with a brief description on
them. Once in-game, I recommend going to
<code>Options... &gt; Controls... &gt; Key binds...</code> and looking
through the controls and rebinding keys if neccessary. Not every key
needs to be bound. If you have any questions about the mods, you can
read about them below. Links to each mod are included.</p>
<h3 id="simple-voice-chat"><a
href="https://modrinth.com/plugin/simple-voice-chat">Simple Voice
Chat</a></h3>
<p>Simple Voice Chat is a mod that adds proximity voice chat in-game.
This means that you need to be within a certain distance in order to
hear other players. Open your settings and look through your key binds.
It will tell you how to use push-to-talk, mute your mic, or open the
voice chat settings. You should see a microphone icon on the bottom left
of the screen while talking. Open the Voice Chat GUI and join a group in
order to voice chat over long distances!</p>
<p>If you plan on using the Simple Voice Chat mod: I would recommend
unbinding everything under voice chat except <code>Voice Chat GUI</code>
and <code>Push To Talk</code> (if applicable). All of the relevant
settings are accessable through the menu.</p>
<h3 id="world-map"><a
href="https://modrinth.com/mod/xaeros-world-map">World Map</a></h3>
<p>This world map allows you to see area you have already explored on
it. It also displays any land claims from Open Parties and Claims.</p>
<p>In the keybinds under <code>Xaero's World Map</code>, make sure that
<code>Open World Map</code> is bound. All of the World Map settings and
minimap settings can be accessed from the map screen by clicking the
gear icon in the top left. It should be bound to the <code>M</code> key
by default.</p>
<h3 id="open-parties-and-claims"><a
href="https://modrinth.com/mod/open-parties-and-claims">Open Parties and
Claims</a></h3>
<p>This mod will allow you to claim land, which will protect it from
fire spread, creepers, and other players.</p>
<p>In the keybinds under <code>Open Parties and Claims</code>, bind
<code>Open Parties and Claims Menu</code> to a key of your choosing.
This will allow you to change the permissions on your land claims.</p>
<h3 id="roughly-enough-items"><a
href="https://modrinth.com/mod/rei">Roughly Enough Items</a></h3>
<p>This mod shows you all the items in the game, and provides
information on how to craft them or use them. You can access the
settings menu by clicking on the gear icon at the bottom of your
inventory screen. By default, pressing the <code>R</code> key while
hovering over an item will show the crafting recipe for it. Pressing the
<code>U</code> key while hovering over an item will show you information
on what the item can be used for. All keybinds in this mod can be
changed by accessing the REI settings by clicking the gear on the
inventory screen.</p>
<h3 id="youre-in-grave-danger"><a
href="https://modrinth.com/mod/yigd">You’re In Grave Danger</a></h3>
<p>This mod adds graves when a player dies. The graves contain all of
the player’s items, so they do not despawn over time. Right-clicking on
the grave automatically arranges all of the items back into your
inventory where they were.</p>
<h3 id="tree-harvester"><a
href="https://modrinth.com/mod/tree-harvester">Tree Harvester</a></h3>
<p>Hold sneak while chopping a tree down with an axe and and it will
chop the entire tree down. You may have break the bottom block a few
times, but it will come down. This is much faster and more convenient
than chopping each block individually. The axe will recieve the same
durability cost as if you chopped each block indiviudally.</p>
<h3 id="betternether-betterend"><a
href="https://modrinth.com/mod/betternether">BetterNether</a> &amp; <a
href="https://modrinth.com/mod/betterend">BetterEnd</a></h3>
<p>These mods add a ton of new biomes, building blocks, items, mobs, and
more to the game. It really is worth checking out both dimensions to see
all of the new stuff they added.</p>
<h3 id="joy-of-painting"><a
href="https://modrinth.com/mod/joy-of-painting">Joy of Painting</a></h3>
<p>Create a canvas, grab your color palette, set up your easel, and
start painting! This paintings can be viewed by other players!</p>
<h3 id="immersive-paintings"><a
href="https://modrinth.com/mod/immersive-paintings">Immersive
Paintings</a></h3>
<p>Import and generate paintings using existing images. The pipeline
from Instagram meme pages staight to the server has never been more
streamlined! They did surgery on a grape!</p>
<h3 id="create"><a
href="https://modrinth.com/mod/create-fabric">Create</a></h3>
<p>This mod is probably the biggest one on the server. It allows you to
automate a whole bunch of tasks using machines. You can learn more about
the mod by clicking on the goggles in-game or pressing <code>W</code>
over a Create machine component in your inventory to ponder it.</p>
<h3 id="modern-industrialization"><a
href="https://modrinth.com/mod/modern-industrialization">Modern
Industrialization</a></h3>
<p>Nuclear reactors, Quarries, Resource Generation, etc. Build and
automate cool infrastructure!</p>
<h3 id="computercraft"><a
href="https://modrinth.com/mod/cc-restitched">ComputerCraft</a></h3>
<p>This mod adds Lua-powered computers and robots to the game. Code your
own programs or import programs found online!</p>
<h1 id="optional-mods">Optional Mods</h1>
<h3 id="midnightcontrols-controller-support"><a
href="https://modrinth.com/mod/midnightcontrols">MidnightControls
(Controller Support)</a></h3>
<p>If you use a controller, this mod adds better support and
intergration for it. This will probably be easier to use than something
like Steam Big Picture mode to setup your controller. I have not set
this up myself, so I would check for a tutorial on youtube on how to use
this mod.</p>
<p>This mod claims to support controllers for Playstation, Xbox,
Nintendo Switch, and more.</p>
<p>To install this mod:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure Minecraft is not currently running. Close it if so.</li>
<li>In the PrismLauncher window, click on the <code>s.n4.cx</code>
modpack instance you installed earlier, and click
<code>Edit</code>.</li>
<li>In the Console window, click <code>Mods</code>, and then
<code>Download mods</code>.</li>
<li>In the Download mods window, click <code>Modrinth</code>, then type
<code>MidnightControls</code>. It should show up as the first
result.</li>
<li>Click on <code>Midnight Controls</code>, and click
<code>select mod for download</code>. Leave the version selected as
default.</li>
<li>Click <code>Review and confirm</code>, then OK. The mod should
download and install.</li>
</ul>
<p>After that you will just need to start up the game and configure it
within the game.</p>
